# UESTC-Thesis-Latex-Template (For International Students)

This repository contains a UESTC LaTeX thesis template designed to help students efficiently write their thesis. The original instructions in [main file](main.tex) were written in Chinese, but I have translated them into English to make the template more accessible and user-friendly for international students. By using this template, students can follow the guidance in English, ensuring a smoother and more efficient thesis-writing process.

For a detailed English guide, read instructions from the [original creator](https://github.com/tinoryj/UESTC-Thesis-Latex-Template) of this template.
